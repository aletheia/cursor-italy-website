Kickstart 2026 with a deep dive into **vibe coding** and **AI-assisted code development**. Come and join us for a full night of ideas, networking, and exceptional talks.

**📅 Date: Martedì 20 gennaio 2026**  
**🕡 Time: 18:30 - 21:00 CET**  
**📍 Location: [Boolean](https://maps.app.goo.gl/boolean-milano), Viale Cassala 22, 20143, Milano**

## 🧭 Designing for Failure and Speed in Agentic AI Workflows

👤 **Speaker:** Alex Casalboni (unleash.io)

Today, producing 1,000 LoC is a sub-minute operation. Reviewing it will take at least 30–60 minutes, even for senior engineers. This gap is becoming the real constraint for teams of any size.

In this talk, we'll focus on how to design agentic workflows in which failure is expected, and correctness is probabilistic. In practice, the challenge shifts toward bug containment, blast-radius reduction, and being able to reverse decisions in production without slowing your team down.

We'll introduce **FeatureOps** to give agents runtime control over how changes are exposed, making reversibility a first-class input to agent planning and the execution of changes.

## 🧪 Office Hours with Cursor team

👤 **Speaker:** TBA

In this session, we will have the opportunity to talk with the Cursor core team engineers, ask them questions, and get a glimpse of upcoming features and a sneak peek under the hood.
